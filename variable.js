// in this i declare variables


var a = "Here i am initialize a variable in javascript";
document.write(a);
var w, v, x;
x = 2;
v = 3;
w = v + x;
document.write(w);

// there 3 type of variable in javascript
//1. var
//2. let-> it is same as var but can't be redeclare
// for example let a=7;
// let a=9; it is wrong
//3. const -> it is for const value, a value which is not change
